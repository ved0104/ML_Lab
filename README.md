Here’s a concise and clear top-level `README.md` for your Git repository that contains multiple lab folders, including Lab 1 and future labs:

# Machine Learning Labs Repository

This repository contains a series of hands-on labs designed to help you learn and implement core machine learning concepts from scratch. Each lab folder contains self-contained code, datasets, and documentation focused on a specific topic.

## Repository Structure

```
/Lab1
/Lab2-
...
```

- **Lab1**:  
  Implements linear regression using Batch and Online Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) from scratch in Python, including detailed explanations on gradient calculation, training loops, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) evaluation.

- **Lab2**:
